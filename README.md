# Free resources
From years of teaching different courses in bioinformatics, I have compiled some images that are vibrant and colourful as they are easy to digest and easy to integrate in slides or reports. Feel free to use them, just don't forget to include a link to the github repo.

All the images were made from scratch using inkscape and using free resources like svgrepo
If you need a copy of the editable SVGs, drop me a message to [vflorelo@gmail.com](mailto:vflorelo@gmail.com)
